Why pay for a Charles Schwab account when you can use a free, OS tool**? This project uses [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/algotrading) to trade stock. You can do paper trading (fake money) or real trading! (Done by changing the config in `resources/api-config.properties`).

** Not responsible for any lost income resulting from using this tool. Try paper trading first!

## Coming soon...
- More trading algorithms (including ML algos)
- Monitoring service to send texts/emails about important trading events
- GUI and/or CLI for trading
